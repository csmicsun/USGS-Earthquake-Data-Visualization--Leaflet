# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

In this homework exercise, I will be practicing using leaflet to plot a map with geojson data from USGS Earthquake Hzards Program. I chose the dataset for M2.5+ in the [Past 7 Days]. Up til when I finished the homework exercise, there were 412 feature counts, indicating the number of earthquakes that are M2.5+.

- Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

- HINT the depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

In addition: I added the mouseover interactions to highlight the circle
Also, I picked my color from ColorBrewer.
